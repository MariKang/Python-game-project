# A Chubby Cat's Adventure

## About
A simple 2-dimensional game developed using pygame library of a cat moving around and collecting ice cream in a given time.

We wanted to create a simple game that incorporated our design skills combined with what we have learned in class. By creating a simple and cute type of gameplay, we wanted to show even a straightforward, not overly-complex game can be fun and spread smiles.
