# A Chubby Cat's Hungry Adventure

## What Was Our Goal?
We wanted to create a simple game that incorporated our design skills combined with what we have learned in class. By creating a simple and cute type of gameplay, we wanted to show even a straightforward, not overly-complex game can be fun and spread smiles.

### Technical Goals:
1. Using pygame functions and material that we had learned throughout the semester, create a game reliant on user input
2. Must incorporate an interactive characteristic of the model!

### Interpersonal Goals:
1. Create something fun, cute, and simple
2. Explore aspects of python that we are unfamiliar with and step out of our comfort zones
3. Successfully collaborate in a remote setting - especially in terms of communication
