# A Chubby Cat's Hungry Adventure

## What Was Our Goal?
We wanted to create a simple game that incorporated our design skills combined with what we have learned in class. By creating a simple and cute type of gameplay, we wanted to show even a straightforward, not overly-complex game can be fun and spread smiles.

### Technical Goals:
1. Using pygame functions and material that we had learned throughout the semester, create a game reliant on user input
2. Must incorporate an interactive characteristic of the model!

### Interpersonal Goals:
1. Create something fun, cute, and simple
2. Explore aspects of python that we are unfamiliar with and step out of our comfort zones
3. Successfully collaborate in a remote setting - especially in terms of communication

## The Unique Features:
We wanted to incorporate a lot of small features that added to the gaming expirience adn understanding.
- **Help Display**: We created a separate visual that would switch between the game display to help guide the user. By pressing the H key, incorporated in the Controller class, the user can view the Help display, leaving by pressing the Esc key. This was done with a boolean switch and has added a piece of guidance for the player.
- **Controller Input**: Other than the Help function, we incorported user input using the arrow keys to move our cat character about the screen. With each arrow press, the velocity of the cat would change, with the preset velocity being done within the Controller code.
- **The Timer**: To add to the game play aspect of this project, we wanted to put pressure on the user. We added a time limit to the game play by measuring the ticks passing once the game starts. This aspect of the game can be adjusted within the timer code, to change the challenge of the game.
